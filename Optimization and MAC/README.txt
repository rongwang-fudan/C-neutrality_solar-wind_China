1. Please run '1.1_optimization_time_pv', '1.2_optimization_time_ons' and '1.3_optimization_time_off' first to optimize building time of PV, onshore wind and offshore wind power plants to minimize total cost, Then run '1.4_optimization_time_IX_all' to integrate them.

2. Then please run '2_power use efficiency and storage' to calculate power use efficiency of each power plan with fixed hourly power load.

3. Then please run '3_trans_capacity and cost' to calculate the cost and capacity of UHV transmission with fixed hourly power load.

4. Then please run '4.1.1_Marginalcost_battery_withtrans', '4.1.2_Marginalcost_mechanicalsto_withtrans' and '4.1.3_compare_LCOE' to caculate the storage choice for each power plant, please '4.1.4_MAC2060' to obtain marginal abatement cost curve in 2060 with fixed hourly power load.

5. Then please run '5.powergenerat_monhour_pv0928_8TW' and '6.hourlypowerload_xz' to optimize the hourly power load in China in 2060.

6. Then please run '7_power use efficiency and storage_xz' to calculate power use efficiency of each power plan with flexible hourly power load.

7. Then please run '8_trans_capacity and cost_xz' to calculate the cost and capacity of UHV transmission with flexible hourly power load.

8. Then please run '9.1.1_Marginalcost_battery_withtrans_xz', '9.1.2_Marginalcost_mechanicalsto_withtrans_xz' and '9.1.3_compare_LCOE_xz' to caculate the storage choice for each power plant, please '9.1.4_MAC2060_xz' to obtain marginal abatement cost curve in 2060 with flexible hourly power load.
